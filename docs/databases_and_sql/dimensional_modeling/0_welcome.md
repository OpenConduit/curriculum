You have learned the logic of data (Set Theory). You are itching to start writing code (SQL). But there is a missing step.

If you start writing SQL against a messy, disorganized database, you will write messy, slow, and unmaintainable code. You cannot build a skyscraper without a blueprint, and you cannot build a Data Warehouse without a model.

The Blueprint is a field guide to the architecture of analytics. We move beyond "tables and rows" to "Facts and Dimensions." You will learn why "clean" data (3rd Normal Form) is actually terrible for analytics, and how to intentionally break the rules to build systems that answer business questions in milliseconds, not minutes.

This isn't just theory; it's the difference between a Junior Data Engineer who writes queries and a Senior Data Engineer who designs systems.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes you have completed **Module 1: Set Theory**.

- You should be comfortable with the concepts of **Sets**, **Relations**, **Cardinality**, and **The Cartesian Product**.
- We will rely on these mathematical definitions to explain why certain database designs explode in size or fail to aggregate correctly.

## Quizzes
Every numbered section wraps up with a 10-question quiz. Think of these as a sanity check. You can take them as many times as you like. There are no grades here—this is simply a tool for you to gauge whether your mental model matches the reality. If you can breeze through the quiz, you are ready to move on.
