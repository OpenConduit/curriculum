# The Specs: Data Engineering Curriculum
Welcome to **The Specs** for [OpenConduit](https://github.com/OpenConduit).

This repository serves as the **architectural blueprint** for our learning path. It contains the core theory, design patterns, and foundational knowledge required to build modern data infrastructure.

## 📘 What is this?
In the world of engineering, you do not pour concrete until you have reviewed the drawings. This repository is that set of drawings.

It is a structured documentation path designed to take you from the first principles of computing and database theory to the complexity of distributed systems and governance.

Unlike scattered blog posts or vendor-specific documentation, these specs are designed to be used in two ways:
1. **Linearly (The Student)**: Read from start to finish to build a complete mental model of the discipline.
2. **Referentially (The Pro)**: Used as a "Standard Operating Procedure" to refresh your memory on specific architectural patterns (e.g., *Normalization forms or Idempotency*).

## 🔗 The Connection to "The Build"
Theory is useless without execution. This repository works in tandem with [The Build (Labs)](https://github.com/OpenConduit/labs).

| The Specs (This Repo) | The Build (Labs Repo) |
|:---|:---|
| The "Why" | The "How" |
| Focuses on architecture and design. | Focuses on implementation and code.
| "How does an index work?" | "Run this Docker container to optimize an index." |
