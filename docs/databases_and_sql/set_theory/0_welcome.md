Most aspiring Data Engineers learn the trade backward. They memorize keywords like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `JOIN` the way a tourist memorizes phrases from a guidebook. They can order a coffee, but they can't have a conversation. They know how to write a query, but they don't understand why the database behaves the way it does.

This module is the correction. We are going to take a step back—before code, before databases, before computers even existed. We are going to explore the mathematical "physics" that governs how data behaves.

We won't just be learning definitions; we will be building a mental engine. By the time we are done, you won't look at a database table and see rows and columns. You will see Sets, Tuples, and Relations.

## Prerequisites
Because this is the foundation, the barrier to entry is low, but the requirement for focus is high. To succeed in this module, you do not need:
- Prior experience with SQL.
- A Computer Science degree.
- A heavy background in calculus or algebra.

However, we will be relying on:
- **Basic Arithmetic**: If you can count items in a box and understand what "zero" means, you are qualified.
- **Logical Thinking**: We will be dealing with strict rules. If $A$ is in $B$, and $B$ is in $C$, where is $A$?

We will be building these concepts from the ground up, so if your math skills are rusty, don't worry. We aren't here to prove theorems; we are here to understand data.

## Quizzes
Every numbered section wraps up with a 10-question quiz. Think of these as a sanity check. You can take them as many times as you like. There are no grades here—this is simply a tool for you to gauge whether your mental model matches the reality. If you can breeze through the quiz, you are ready to move on.
